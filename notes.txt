****üîπ Flux Bootstrap (GitHub)
       ----------------------- 

This is the one that sets up Flux in your cluster and connects it to a GitHub repo:

                flux bootstrap github \
                --owner=<github-username-or-org> \
                --repository=<repo-name> \
                --branch=main \
                --path=./clusters/dev \
                --personal


        --owner ‚Üí your GitHub username or org name

        --repository ‚Üí the repo you want Flux to manage

        --branch ‚Üí branch Flux should track (often main)

        --path ‚Üí directory inside the repo where cluster configs live

        --personal ‚Üí add this if the repo is under your personal GitHub account


Flux will install its controllers (source-controller, kustomize-controller, etc.) into your cluster and push some bootstrap manifests to your repo.

    üîπ Common Flux Commands:
       #####################

            Verify Flux installation:
                flux check --pre


            (Checks pre-requisites and cluster readiness before bootstrap.):

                flux check

            Manage Sources (Git/GitHub, Helm repos, Buckets):
                flux get sources git
                flux get sources helm

            Manage Kustomizations (deployments synced from Git):
                flux get kustomizations
                flux reconcile kustomization <name> --with-source

            Sync with Git on-demand:
                flux reconcile source git <repo-name>

            Manage Helm releases:
                flux get helmreleases
                flux reconcile helmrelease <release-name> --with-source

            Debugging:
                flux logs -f


(Stream logs from Flux controllers in the flux-system namespace.):

    ‚ö°Ô∏è In practice, the workflow is usually:

           1- flux bootstrap github ... ‚Üí set up repo + controllers.

           2- Push manifests to repo (clusters/dev/...).

           3- flux reconcile kustomization <name> --with-source when you want immediate sync.

           4- Use flux get ... commands to inspect.

            
NB:  
        What happens under the hood:
        ############################

                           - tf-controller watches this CR.
               
                           -  It spawns a tf-runner Pod/Job automatically.

                           - That runner:

                           -  fetches the module from Git,

                           - does terraform init/plan/apply,

                           -  writes outputs into a K8s Secret.

                           - Runner pods die after execution (they‚Äôre ephemeral).
